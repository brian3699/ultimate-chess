### A variant of chess 'Chess vs Chinese Chess' and AI player

![](resources/images/chess-play.gif)

## Project Overview

This project implements two games, 'Chess' and 'Chess vs. Chinese Chess.' The variant 'Chess vs. Chinese Chess' is a board
game that my grandfather and I used to play when I was young. I plan to add multiplayer support so that others can enjoy this unique Chess variant.

All classes are well-refactored and follow the OOP principle and MVC pattern. I implemented the Chess game first and used the existing classes to create 'Chess vs. Chinese Chess.'
## AI Player 
Created an AI player using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The current setting checks up to step 2 for performance issues from recursion.
I plan to add AI players that use more complex algorithm in the future.
